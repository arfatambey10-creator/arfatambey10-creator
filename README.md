Hi, I’m Arfa

I’m an Applied AI & Python Engineer with a strong focus on building production-style systems, not just experimental scripts.

My work centres on:

Document intelligence

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Clean backend architecture

Practical AI engineering trade-offs (quality, latency, cost)


What I Work On

Enterprise Document Intelligence

Applied NLP & Information Retrieval

Python backend systems

AI system evaluation and reliability

I’m particularly interested in how AI systems behave in real products, not just how models perform in isolation.


Featured Project
Enterprise Document Intelligence System (RAG)

A modular, production-style document intelligence system built in Python using Retrieval-Augmented Generation principles.

Highlights:

Clean ingestion → chunking → retrieval → response pipeline

Emphasis on retrieval quality over raw model output

Mocked LLM for cost-free, reproducible evaluation

Designed with real-world constraints in mind
