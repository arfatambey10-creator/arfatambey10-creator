Hi, I’m Arfa 👋
I am an Applied AI & Python Engineer completed my MSc in Electrical & Electronics Engineering at Coventry University. I specialise in bridging the gap between complex research (LLMs, Computer Vision) and production-ready, maintainable systems.
Core Focus & Engineering Philosophy
My work is driven by first-principles thinking and a commitment to correctness and reliability. I focus on:
• Document Intelligence & RAG: Building systems that prioritise retrieval quality, semantic similarity, and efficient context construction.
• Computer Vision & Perception: Developing real-time processing pipelines using OpenCV and MediaPipe for gesture-based control and feature extraction.
• System Integration: Expertise in hardware-software integration, combining Python ML with MATLAB/Simulink and TCP/IP communication.
• Engineering Excellence: Implementing modular software development, disciplined testing, and systematic debugging to solve non-trivial problems.

Featured Projects
1. Enterprise Document Intelligence System (RAG)
A modular, production-style system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation to transform raw PDFs into actionable insights.
• Highlights: Clean ingestion → chunking → retrieval → response pipeline.
• Innovation: Features a mocked LLM for cost-free, reproducible evaluation and high-efficiency batching.
2. Hand-Gesture Controlled Robotic System
My MSc Dissertation project involving a real-time gesture-based control pipeline.
• Highlights: Uses Python-based video processing and supervised machine learning (scikit-learn) to control mobile robots with high precision.
• Innovation: Resolved complex misclassification issues through task-specific data curation and first-principles analysis.

• Stack: Python, LLMs (RAG), OpenCV, MediaPipe, MATLAB/Simulink, Scikit-learn, Git.
Let's Connect
I am interested in how AI systems behave in real-world products, focusing on the trade-offs between quality, latency, and cost.
